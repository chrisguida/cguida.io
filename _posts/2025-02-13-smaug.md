# Introducing Smaug

## A CLN plugin to watch your bitcoin treasury with a meticulous eye

Smaug is a new CLN plugin that sends bkpr-compatible events to the bkpr plugin for external on-chain wallet movements. This allows bkpr to maintain a full picture of a merchant's bitcoin inflows and outflows, vastly improving bitcoin accounting and financial analysis.

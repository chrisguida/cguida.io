excerpt: "Chris Guida: bitcoin and lightning ecosystem dev and educator"
---

My name is Chris Guida and I'm a bitcoin and lightning ecosystem dev and educator.

I've been a professional dev since 2010 and I've been working full time in the bitcoin ecosystem since 2020.

## Mission

My mission is to make bitcoin the best medium of exchange ever, so it can finally supplant the fiat standard, thereby separating money from state and igniting a new Renaissance.

To get there, we need to teach people how bitcoin works so they can take back sovereignty in their lives, and we especially need to onboard merchants to lightning, a payment system that shows why bitcoin's permissionless nature is a competitive advantage over more corruptible systems (i.e., fiat and altcoins).

The more people there are who deeply understand bitcoin, and the more merchants there are accepting bitcoin for their products and running their own nodes, the more sustainably decentralized, and thus successful, bitcoin becomes.

## Current work

Recently I've been focused primarily on building approachable lightning nodes and accounting tools for merchants, as I consider this the easiest area to make a big impact.

I am extremely grateful to those who support my work, especially OpenSats, who generously funded my project [smaug](https://opensats.org/blog/bitcoin-and-nostr-grants-august-2023#watchdescriptor).
